# Contributing

This is a small project, with one primary developer (so far!), so contributing should be pretty straight forward as you'll just need to convince one person :smile:.

It'll be worth your time letting me know what you want to do, before doing it (unless it's too late :innocent:). This will save you some effort if your idea is not likely to be accepted by me.

If you have a found a bug, make sure you're pretty confident with your discovery before reporting it, this saves us wasting a precious issue number :grinning:.

Cheers,
